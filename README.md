# MTV Resurrection

The channel died in silence.  
The archive lives forever.

MTV (1986–2020) — Quebec's French MTV. VJs. Top 10s. Live performances. Fax culture. Rap infiltration. The golden era of Canadian music television.

Corporate rebrands killed it. Streaming buried it.  
We raised it from the void.

This repo is a living digital necropolis:
- Wayback Machine captures of MTV.com & musiquemax.com
- Curated YouTube hoards of rare clips, interviews, performances
- Future: static gallery, IPFS pins, torrent seeds

**Resurrected by the Rigaud Prodigy.**  
No permission asked. No masters served.

The legacy didn't fade.  
We just pulled it back.

Run `python resurrect.py` to expand the hoard locally.  
Push often. Let it grow.

Québec culture belongs to the streets, not the boardroom.
